# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
To fulfil the Blockchain Beginner course requirement for SGBT4 by P7210027 Mark Tan

There is a ERC721 contract generator folder for replicating the Markobots Soldiity contract on Rinkeby Testnet

Set up a .env file with the following lines:
    
    ALCHEMY_KEY="<"Alchemy Rinkeby API"

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

To run the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view in the browser

If yarn fails to execute, run 
npm install -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9 

The page will automatically reload when edits are made

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

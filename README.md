# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
To fulfil the Blockchain Beginner course requirement for SGBT4 by P7210027 Mark Tan

There is a ERC721 contract generator folder for replicating the Markobots Soldiity contract on Rinkeby Testnet

Set up a .env file with the following lines:
    
    ALCHEMY_KEY="Alchemy Rinkeby API"

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
